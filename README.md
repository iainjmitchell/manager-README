# Working with me
This document gives you an idea about what it's like working with me in one of my teams at the BBC.

## My role  
My role is about:
* Setting context
* Enabling communication
* Helping you to become what *you* want to become
* Ensuring that architecturally we are heading towards organisational goals 

I am not completely hands-off. I do like to be involved in technical decisions and occasionally I may get to pair with you. But I do this as an equal, not as a micro-manager.

## 1-2-1 meetings
I will schedule in a weekly 30 min meeting with you.  But this is *your* time to discuss anything that is important to you.  These have been used for talking through problem/challenges, chatting about short/long term career goals or just generally catching up.

Occasionally, I won't be able to make 1-2-1s due to being out of the office.  If this happens, it is up to you to decide on whether you want to rearrange or wait until the next week.

I try to avoid giving feedback in 1-2-1s as I believe that feedback is best given straight away whilst both of us still have the context to mind.

## Feedback
I am a strong advocate of both positive and constructive feedback.  Though I really don't like [sh*t sandwich](https://medium.com/@clavien/enough-of-the-shit-sandwich-how-to-do-feedback-better-985350eb958) feedback.  

The best feedback can be from your peers - as they get to work with you day in and out.  So, I strongly encourage you to give both positive and negative feedback to your co-workers.  They don't bite (usually).  You'll be doing them a disservice and maybe damage their career if you don't give them the feedback they need. Also, if you give me feedback about a peer I will always encourage you to tell them.

I expect you to receive any feedback well. Don't argue, seriously don't argue, even if you disagree.  Ask clarifying questions, but don't argue as this may put the other person off giving feedback in the future.  Also, in the future you may re-reflect and decide there were merits to the feedback.

I also expect *you* to give me feedback.  If I don't receive enough, I will send out an anonymous survey - but it would be best not to use this.

## My working style
I have a coaching style to my leadership, though I will give direct instruction when required.  Also, I believe that the _most_ decisions should be made by the team, not by myself or any other dominant personalities within the team. 

I am a strong advocate of an agile approach to working, so I will generally shun unnecessary bureaucracy and any fixed approaches to working.  Please do challenge me if you think I'm going too far with this!

I believe in work/life balance, so I won't read nor respond to emails or slack messages at weekends or after hours.  For emergencies you will have my personal phone number.
